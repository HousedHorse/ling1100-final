## Signed Languages (Basic Properties)

- distinct from languages around them
- all design features of human language
    - duality of patterning
- iconicity (an exception to arbitrariness of the sign)
- suprasegmental (stress, facial expression, etc.)
- pronouns by location

## Parameters in Sign Language Phonology

- at least one of these must change during the sign
- parameters
    - location
    - direction
    - handshape
    - non-manual markers
- assimilation -> signs taking on parameters of neighboring signs
    - this happens in spoken English too
- affixation
    - prefixes or suffixes

## Similarities and Differences Between Signed and Spoken Languages

### Similarities

#### Syntax

- spoken
    - word order changes for questions / passive form
- signed
    - SVO is typical word order
    - other word orders occur frequently as well

#### Phonology

- spoken
    - words combined through syntax
- signed
    - meaningless elements to meaningful parts
    - words are combined through syntax

#### Simultaneity of Features

- spoken
    - only one utterance at a time
- signed
    - still severe constraints on multiple things happening at once

### Differences

#### Suprasegmental

- spoken
    - pitch/timbre
- signed
    - facial expressions

#### Iconicity

- spoken
    - some iconicity in spoken language
    - fewer things that can be represented audibly than visually
- signed
    - signs bear visual similarity to messages

#### Discreteness

- spoken
    - 3 layers
    - features, sounds, words
- signed
    - 2 layers
    - features, words

## Natural vs Artificial Form in Poetry and Music

- both
    - rules are formally complex
    - acquired automatically
- natural
    - same sense as language
    - categories from elsewhere in language
    - rule types from elsewhere in language
    - stress, syllables, consonant vs vowel, iambic pentameter
- artificial
    - artificial rules
    - greater conscious control than grammar
    - can only be learned artificially
    - e.g., increase letter by one every line

## Textsetting, Sung Verse (Drunken Sailor)

- textsetting
    - syllables at regular intervals
    - regardless of what word you're on
    - AKA isochronic

### Drunken Sailor Song

- Halle and Lerdahl
    - figure out grammar of the song
    - ability to improvise implied there was a rule
- line up syllables to the beat of the song (textsetting)
- find stressed syllables and link to the strongest beats
- language stress and rhythm operate independently

## Meter, Metrical Template

- meter
    - recurring pattern of stresses or accents
    - provide a pulse / beat
- iambic pentameter
    - sequence of weak/strong beats = foot
    - 5 iambic feet
    - WS WS WS WS WS
- intuitive hypothesis
    - stressed -> strong
    - unstressed -> weak
    - only 6.8% of Shakespeare's sonnets comply
- open-classed words
    - stressed -> verbs, nouns, adjectives, adverbs
- closed-classed words
    - unstressed -> articles, general functioning words
- metrical template
    - grammatical representation of the meter
    - WSWSWS WSWSWS WSWSWS...

## Core English Metrical Constraint

- linguistic representation also has stressed and unstressed syllables
- perfect lines -> complete match between W and unstressed, S and stressed
    - most lines are not perfect
- the imperfect way of doing it:
    - S -> any syllable
    - W -> only unstressed syllables
    - exception: the line-initial W can be any syllable IF it's a 1-syllable word
- not identical to WSWSWS pattern but does not depart far

## Metrical Tension/Counterpoint

### Tension

- mismatch between weak/strong pattern of template and line
- produced through
    - gradual motion to higher or lower pitch
    - reiteration
    - increase in dynamic level
    - partial syncopations between consonance and dissonance

### Counterpoint

- mismatch between linguistic representation and metrical template
- harmonically dependent, independent in rhythm and contour
