## Signed Languages (Basic Properties)

- distinct from languages around them
- all design features of human language
    - duality of patterning
- iconicity (an exception to arbitrariness of the sign)
- suprasegmental (stress, facial expression, etc.)
- pronouns by location

## Parameters in Sign Language Phonology

- at least one of these must change during the sign
- parameters
    - location
    - direction
    - handshape
    - non-manual markers
- assimilation -> signs taking on parameters of neighboring signs
    - this happens in spoken English too
- affixation
    - prefixes or suffixes

## Similarities and Differences Between Signed and Spoken Languages

### Similarities

#### Syntax

- spoken
    - word order changes for questions / passive form
- signed
    - SVO is typical word order
    - other word orders occur frequently as well

#### Phonology

- spoken
    - words combined through syntax
- signed
    - meaningless elements to meaningful parts
    - words are combined through syntax

#### Simultaneity of Features

- spoken
    - only one utterance at a time
- signed
    - still severe constraints on multiple things happening at once

### Differences

#### Suprasegmental

- spoken
    - pitch/timbre
- signed
    - facial expressions

#### Iconicity

- spoken
    - some iconicity in spoken language
    - fewer things that can be represented audibly than visually
- signed
    - signs bear visual similarity to messages

#### Discreteness

- spoken
    - 3 layers
    - features, sounds, words
- signed
    - 2 layers
    - features, words

## Natural vs Artificial Form in Poetry and Music

- both
    - rules are formally complex
    - acquired automatically
- natural
    - same sense as language
    - categories from elsewhere in language
    - rule types from elsewhere in language
    - stress, syllables, consonant vs vowel, iambic pentameter
- artificial
    - artificial rules
    - greater conscious control than grammar
    - can only be learned artificially
    - e.g., increase letter by one every line

## Textsetting, Sung Verse (Drunken Sailor)

- textsetting
    - syllables at regular intervals
    - regardless of what word you're on
    - AKA isochronic

### Drunken Sailor Song

- Halle and Lerdahl
    - figure out grammar of the song
    - ability to improvise implied there was a rule
- line up syllables to the beat of the song (textsetting)
- find stressed syllables and link to the strongest beats
- language stress and rhythm operate independently

## Meter, Metrical Template

- meter
    - recurring pattern of stresses or accents
    - provide a pulse / beat
- iambic pentameter
    - sequence of weak/strong beats = foot
    - 5 iambic feet
    - WS WS WS WS WS
- intuitive hypothesis
    - stressed -> strong
    - unstressed -> weak
    - only 6.8% of Shakespeare's sonnets comply
- open-classed words
    - stressed -> verbs, nouns, adjectives, adverbs
- closed-classed words
    - unstressed -> articles, general functioning words
- metrical template
    - grammatical representation of the meter
    - WSWSWS WSWSWS WSWSWS...

## Core English Metrical Constraint

- linguistic representation also has stressed and unstressed syllables
- perfect lines -> complete match between W and unstressed, S and stressed
    - most lines are not perfect
- the imperfect way of doing it:
    - S -> any syllable
    - W -> only unstressed syllables unless one syllable word
    - exception: the first W can be stressed for any word
- not identical to WSWSWS pattern but does not depart far

## Metrical Tension/Counterpoint

### Tension

- mismatch between weak/strong pattern of template and line
- produced through
    - gradual motion to higher or lower pitch
    - reiteration
    - increase in dynamic level
    - partial syncopations between consonance and dissonance

### Counterpoint

- mismatch between linguistic representation and metrical template
- harmonically dependent
- independent in rhythm and contour

## Structural Differences Between Sung and Written Verse

- sung verse -> generally not as strict
- written verse -> generally iambic pentameter

## Musical Grammar, Judgements

- experienced listeners can tell what's right and wrong
- grammatical judgements -> a speaker's judgement on how well-formed a string is
- musical grammatical judgement is called musical idiom

## Properties Shared by Music and Language

### Grouping / Constituency

- utterances have hierarchal grouping and structure
    - -> constituents can be inside other constituents

### Headedness

- noun phrase has a head
- musical strings have a head

### Rhythm

- regular alternation of strong and weak
- prosody -> patterns of rhythm and sound used in poetry

### Recursion

- organized into constituents
- constituents inside constituents
- grouping signaled through how it sounds (pitch, duration, intonation)

### Features Shared

1. Syntax
1. Phonology
1. Discreteness
1. Recursion

## Differences Between Musical and Linguistic Structure

- finite set of available pitches
    - continuous in language, discrete in music
- equivalence of pitches that differ by a multiple of 2
    - 110Hz, 220Hz, 440Hz, 880Hz = A
    - possible linguistic parallel? phoneme corresponds to multiple sounds... but this is weak
- tonality -> "home key" as the central tone of a piece
    - other pitches have tension/instability
- musical idioms
    - conventional sequences build and resolve tension
- simultaneity
    - in language you mostly can't do two things at once
    - suprasegmental stuff, yes
    - but you can't say two things at once

## Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis

- language shapes thought
- the way you speak determines the way you think (strong form)
    - not a strong contender
- the way you speak *influences* the way you think (weak form)
    - this is a more realistic contender
- language is merely a part of culture (weakest form)
    - this is obviously *at least* true, but the above may be true as well

## Studies Investigating Language and Culture

### Language and Color

- colors within category are harder to perceive differences than colors across categories
    - e.g., two shades of red vs red and orange
    - this is true even when distance on the spectrum is the same
- tested English and Russian speakers
    - in English, one category for blue
    - in Russian, two categories for blue
    - other color used as a control
    - Russian speakers very slightly better at distinguishing
- two possibilities:
    1. Russian speakers are using different perceptual systems
    1. subjects are using language to think about color
- give a simultaneous linguistic task to make language unavailable for the color task
    - difference disappears
    - possibility 2 is the winner

### Language and Time

- next Wednesdays meeting has been moved forward two days
    - is it on Monday?
    - is it on Friday?
    - how do you position yourself relative to time
- do you perceive yourself:
    - moving forward through time?
    - time moving forward around you?
- spacial primes
    - related tasks prime people to answer one way or the other
    - people who had been standing in line for long time were more likely to say Friday
    - people who had just flown (perceived themselves as moving) answer Friday
- the fact that this can change (based on priming) goes against SWH
- Borodistky (2001)
    - Mandarin and English native speakers
    - Mandarin -> vertical time concept
    - English -> horizontal time concept
    - exposed to primer images
    - vertical bias greater for those who started learning English later in life

### Language and Space

- studied Guugu Yimidhiir and English
    - English -> relative
    - Guugu Yimidhiir -> absolute
- Levinson (1997)
    - do Guugu Yimidhiir retain relative or absolute positions in memory
    - speakers use language to encode memory
    - so, yes, there was a difference between English and Guugu Yimidhiir
