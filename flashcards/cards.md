# Pre-Midterm

## Syntax

- putting words together to create sentences

## Phonology

- combining phonemes (sounds) to make words

## Properties of Human Language

- duality of patterning
- arbitrariness of the sign
- discrete
- productivity
- reflexive
- recursive
- displacement
- cultural learning

## Arbitrariness of the Sign

- sounds unconnected to meaning

## Exceptions to Arbitrariness of the Sign?

- onomatopoeia
- sound symbolism

## Onomatopoeia

- words that sound like what they are

## Sound Symbolism

- kiki, buba
- we know what each one looks like

## Duality of Patterning

- phonology + syntax

## Discrete

- discrete units
- not a continuous scale
- tone in conversation can be continuous but since writing exists, we can infer it is not essential

## Productivity

- discrete infinity
- we can make infinite possible combinations of words

## Reflexive

- use language to talk about itself

## Recursive

- sentences can contain sentences

## Displacement

- talk about abstract things, not here

## Cultural Learning

- learn language from culture around you

## Signed Languages

- not different from other language
- same features as other human language
- not word-for-word translations of languages around them
    - verbal aspect
    - classifiers
    - word order

## Humans vs Apes Vocal Tract

### Humans

- shorter tongue
- lower larynx
- tongue can move more freely, can chocker more easily

### Apes

- larger tongue
- higher larynx

## In General, Animal Language Lacks...

- true productivity
- discrete combinatorial system

## Bee Language

- waggle dance
- two continuous scales
    - direction
    - duration

## Bird Language

- three stages of learning
- learn from parents
- discrete units -> phonology but no syntax

## Ape Communication

- aggression
- submission

## Vervet Monkeys

- alarm calls for predators
- lexicon...
    - but no syntax or phonology

## Who Can Learn Simple Algebraic Rules?

- rhesus monkeys
- rats

## Who Can Learn Finite State Grammars?

- tamarins
- birds

## Who Can Learn Regular Grammars?

- humans
- tamarins

## Who Can Learn Context Free Grammars?

- only humans

## Language Family

- descended from a common ancestor
- systematic differences between sounds

## Cognates

- words with common ancestor between languages
- the horizontal relationships in a language tree

## Proto-Languages

- common ancestor languages
- can be reconstructed with comparative method
- earliest possible language was 50,000 years ago
- earliest known language was 5,000 years ago

## Comparative Method

- feature-by-feature comparison of two languages
- study language development
- reconstruct proto-languages

## Dialect Maps

- maps of language features
- isoglosses

## Isoglosses

- boundaries on dialect maps

## Canadian Shift

- cot and caught merge
- bet moves down
- pat move back

## Northern Cities Shift

- bet moves up
- pat moves forward

## On a Dialect Map The Older Feature Is...

- large
- disconnected

## On a Dialect Map The Younger Feature Is...

- smaller
- united

## AAVE

- habitual be
- negative concord
- copula absence

## Habitual Be

- she be runnin'
- she has the habit of running

## Negative Concord

- ain't nobody seen him

## Copula Absence

- he in trouble!

## Register

- based on social context
- formal, informal

## Informal Register

- flapping
- unstressed vowel deletion
- contractions

## Flapping

- tt becomes dd

## Prescriptive Rules

- one of the variants is prescribed
- this becomes the formal register

## Gender Differences

- girls overestimate their use of standard variants
- boys underestimate their use of standard variants
- girls are farther along in language change than men
- girls use non-standard variants with peers
- boys use non-standard variants with interviewers

## Phonemes

- unit of phonetics
- discrete sound

## Allophone

- different pronunciations for phonemes

## Minimal Pair

- words that differ by one sound

## Presupposition

- implicit assumption from an utterance
- Jim no longer walks on the beach -> Jim used to walk on the beach

## Implicature

- stronger implication from an utterance
- the *frame* is good -> but the painting is bad

## Grice's Maxims

- speakers are good
- act in good faith
- cooperative
- assume others are cooperative
- quantity, quality, reverence

## Syntactic Bootstrapping

- children use syntax to learn words

## Phonological Bootstrapping

- children learn word boundary from probability two phonemes are next to each other

## Word Segmentation

- probability two sounds next to each other
- this is how phonological bootstrapping works

## Parental Feedback

- children don't need it for their native language
- Simon learned ASL better than his parents
- Trackton study

## Assumptions Guiding Word Learning

- whole object assumption
- taxonomic assumption
- mutual exclusivity assumption

## Whole Object Assumption

- words refer to whole objects

## Taxonomic Assumption

- words refer to the same class of objects

## Mutual Exclusivity Assumption

- there is a 1-to-1 mapping of words to objects

## Pidgin

- comes from a substrate and a lexifier (superstrate) meeting
- crude communication system
- not a real language

## Creole

- develops from a pidgin
- children assign implicit grammatical rules to pidgin and develop it

## Substrate

- lower socio-political status language
- gets overtaken by the superstrate

## Superstrate

- lexifier
- higher socio-political status language
- overtakes substrate
- contributes most of its grammar and lexicon

## Language Bioprogram Hypothesis

- children faced with pidgins impose structure upon them
- universal human grammar
- turn pidgins into creoles

## Critical Period Hypothesis

- period in childhood when language acquisition is easier
- start slowly, progress further than adults

## Nicaraguan Sign Language

- emerged spontaneously
- a creole formed from all the different household language systems
- an opportunity to study a language as it is being born

# Post-Midterm

## Properties of Signed Languages

- same design features of human language
- distinct from languages around them
    - word order
    - suprasegmental pronouns in ASL

## Sign Language Parameters

- place
- movement
- handshape
- orientation
- non-manual markers

## Can You Sign Two Things At Once?

- no
- passive hand either does same as dominant hand or stays still

## Iconicty

- signs look like things they represent
- exception to arbitrariness of the sign
- this is more common in sign language

## Assimilation

- signs take on parameters of neighboring signs

## Affixation

- suffixes and prefixes
- these exist in sign language too

## Natural Form vs Artificial Form

### Natural Form

- same sense as language
- we have a natural sense for correct or incorrect
- hard to prescribe overt rules to it
- stress, syllables, iambic pentameter

### Artificial Form

- artificial rules
- increasing first letter by one each time, etc.

## Textsetting

- isochronic
- putting syllables are regular intervals

## Meter

- recurring pattern of stresses / accents
- provides a pulse or beat

## Metrical Template

- like iambic pentameter
- WSWSWSWSWS

## Closed-Class Words

- one syllable
- unstressed
- articles, general functioning words

## Open-Class Words

- one syllable
- stressed
- words that accept new types, like nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs

## Core English Metrical Constraint

- WSWSWSWSWS
- perfect lines match perfectly with stressed and unstressed
- but most lines are not perfect (6.8% in Shakespeare's sonnets)
- only weak can go on weak except:
    - first weak OR
    - one syllable strong

## Metrical Tension

- when template does not align with text
- fugues

## Metrical Counterpoint

- dependent harmony
- independent rhythm
- African music

## Sung Vs Written Structure

- sung is less rigid
- written guided by metrical templates (like iambic pentameter)

## Musical Grammatical Judgements

- listeners have an idea of what is correct
- musical idiom
- not so much for extremely irregular patterns
    - artificial vs natural

## Properties Shared By Music and Language

- grouping / constituency
- headedness
- rhythm
- recursion
- syntax
- phonology
- discreteness

## Music Grouping / Constituency

- constituents are grouped together
- dum di di dum | di | dum di di dum di
    - which boundary is correct?

## Music Headedness

- part of the "phrase" whose removal turns it into gibberish
- the first "dum" in the above example

## Music Rhythm

- strong and weak alternation
- prosody -> rhythm in poetry

## Music Recursion

- constituents inside constituents

## Music Syntax

- proper ordering of notes in a scale

## Music Phonology

- pitches -> phonemes
- unlike in speech, these repeat every doubled frequency

## Discreteness

- but unlike in language, pitch is also discrete

## Difference Between Music and Language

- tonality
- equivalence for pitch multiples of two
- finite set of pitches
- musical idioms (conventional sequences build and resolve tension)
- simultaneity

## Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis

- language shapes thought
- the way you speak determines how you think
- OR the way you speak *influences* the way you think
- OR language is merely a part of culture

## Language and Color

- shades of blue in Russian vs English
- Russians have two distinct categories, so they did better
- under linguistic load, both did the same

## Language and Time

- moving forward through time or time moving past you
- meeting on Wednesday pushed forward two days
    - people said either Monday or Friday
    - people who had been travelling or waiting in line said Friday
- horizontal vs vertical representations of time
    - age when you started learning a language affects this

## Language and Space

- relative vs absolute positioning
    - relative -> forward, back, left, right
    - absolute -> North, South, East, West
- speakers use language to encode memory
- so there was a difference between English (relative) and Guugu Yimhidiir (absolute)

## Endangerment Causes

- colonial interactions
- missionary work
- disruptions
- educational policy (residential schools)
- lack of official recognition

## Loss Causes

- almost no record of it
- last native speaker dies
- shift to different languages

## Goal of Language Documentation

- benefit communities and scholars
- work with endangered communities
- ideally one-to-one correspondence between letters and phonemes
    - not always possible
- dictionary-making

## Common Ethical Issues

- might only benefit researcher
- might cause socio-political harm to language community
- privacy issues with data
- language can have spiritual value

## Prepositional Model

- research with speakers rather than on speakers
- research for speakers rather than for linguists
- research by speakers *and* linguists
